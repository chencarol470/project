                    target="_blank">destroying</a> the world, and we could be the last that
                can do anything about it. Speaking up is one of the most powerful things you can do especially
                if it’s to the right people. Talk to the right organization. Tell them to commit to action to protect
                our
                natural world.
                Contact the brands you buy from and get them to tell you how their products are sourced. Use
                social media – this is one of the most effective ways to get brands to listen to you, so tell
                them that you want a change.
                It’s not just about speaking to the people in charge. Talk to your friends, neighbours and
                colleagues and get them to make positive changes too. Speak up, speak to everyone, and make your
                voice heard.</p>
